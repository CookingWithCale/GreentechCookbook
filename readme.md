# Oregon-Cooler

A green air conditioner and concrete replacement mimicked after forests, caves, and gardens. The Oregon Cooler is in concept and we're awaiting getting some real-world measurements and total-carbon-emissions estimates. Please join us as a contributor on GitHub at <https://github.com/CaleMcCollough/oregon-cooler>.

## Mission and Vision

The mission of Oregon-Cooler is to put a green air conditioner into every home in the world and replace concrete in residential areas with negative-carbon technology. Our vision is to reduce over 1% of global warming emissions.
