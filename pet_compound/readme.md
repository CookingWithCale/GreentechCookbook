## Pet Compound

The Pet Compound is an addition to the Oregon-Cooler products that is a heated outdoor pet house that fits between two Salt-log Dehumifiers and adds insulation to your windows.

Pet Compounds are a good addition to your home because they are attractive, low-cost, they are easy to decorate and put plants on, and pets love them.
