### Organization

Oregon-Cooler is a KabukiPress application that you can learn about in the Getting Started chapter of the KabukiPress Cookbook located at <https://github.com/kabuki-starship/kabuki.press.cookbook>. The Oregon Cooler consists of hardware designs, firmware to control the hardware, and software to interface between the hardware and the user.

#### Hardware

The hardware designs can be found in the hardware folder of the Oregon-Cooler repository at <https://github.com/oregon-cooler/oregoncooler/tree/master/hardware>. Each hardware project is sorted into a directory that you can brows on GitHub using a web browser.

##### Firmware

Oregon-Cooler firmware is programmed in Modern Embedded-C++ with the IGEEK Toolkit located at <https://github.com/kabuki-starship/igeek.toolkit>, which is built on top of [ARM mbed](mbed.com)®. Each Oregon-Cooler hardware product has it's own firmware, that you can find in the folder for that hardware device.

#### Software

The Oregon-Cooler Software consists of a web service server, a client application, and the `oregoncooler.org` website. In order to keep the hardware green, we have to re-use parts we already have aroudn our house, and interface everything toghter with really efficient software.

##### Server

The Oregon-Cooler server is an extendable web server for a smart-home or smart-city that can be used to create a variety of different Greentech devices and platforms. The server is responsible for managing IoT device clouds, control smart-homes and cities, and provide an infostructure for addicional services.

##### Client 

The Oregon-Cooler client application interfaces with the Oregon-Cooler Server to allows you to monitor, analise, and control your home and city.
