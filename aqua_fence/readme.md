### Aqua Fence

18% of electric in homes is used to heat water, and most of this energy is used to heat the water from cold to warm[1]. The Oregon-Cooler solution is to replace East-West facing fences with vacuum sealed solar water heaters. This ist he origianl design that was intended to vaporize water to remove salt water, that turned into the Water Fence.
